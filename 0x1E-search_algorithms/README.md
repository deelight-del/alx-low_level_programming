## SEARCH ALGORITHM

According to wikipedia, a search algorithm is an
algorithm that is designed to solve a search problem.


A search problem on a further probe, involves finding structure
"x" inside object "y". Thus, a search algorithm is expected to return
the ouput "x" when it can be found, or output "Not found" or something
similar when it cannot find "x".


Based on the behaviour/way that an algorithm uses to search through for
a structure, search algorithms can be classified as `Linear Search`,
`Binary Search`, and `Hashing`.

The following directory will explore some of the known search algorithms
and applications in simple cases.
